## What is this?

**Algo** is a compendium of algorithms and data structures I've
encountered and don't want to forget.

## Yeah, but why?

I got interested on algorithms and data structures during my time a part of my university's competitive
programming team and I've tried to keep practicing ever since. I figured I needed a way to quickly
remember what I've done so I can spend my time on learning new things.
