## What is this? 

Toolbox (<em>for lack of a better name</em>) is a compendium of algorithms and data structures I've encountered and don't want to forget.

<a name="purpose"/>
## Yeah, but why?

I got interested on algorithms and data structures as a member of my university's competitive programming team and I've tried not to stop practicing since. I figured I needed a way to quickly remember what I've done to spend my time on learning new things.

## How can I help?

This code is open and free to use by anyone. If I wanted it to be private, I wouldn't have chosen [Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/) as its guardian. If you find errors or want to contribute to the project, go ahead and contact me or issue a Pull Request.

## Disclaimer
As said before, this code is free to use by anyone. This are just implementations of algorithms and data structures created by people I admire. I do my best to ensure these implementations work correctly, yet I take no responsibility for any possible consecuence of their use.
